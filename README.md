# MOD5_Counter

This Verilog repository implements a **MOD-5 counter** that is used to count from ***0 to 4*** and repeat.
<br/> A Mod 5 counter is a digital circuit that counts in a cyclic sequence from 0 to 4 and then resets to 0. In the context of a Verilog module, the counter typically consists of a register to store the current count and logic to increment the count on each clock cycle. The Mod 5 counter is designed to reach a maximum count of 4 before resetting to 0, creating a counting sequence that repeats every 5 clock cycles. 
<br/> The counter can be reset manually using a reset signal, ensuring that it starts counting from zero. This type of counter is commonly used in digital systems where a cyclical counting sequence with a specific modulus is required, such as in applications where a modulo operation is needed.
